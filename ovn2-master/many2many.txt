
    What happens if you switch the order of the statements wgp.Wait() and close(ch) in the end of the main function?
    Answer: Wait will then not be able to block the close of the channel which can result in the fact that not all producers
            get to send to the consumers which creates a panic.

    What happens if you move the close(ch) from the main function and instead close the channel in the end of the function Produce?
    Answer: The channel is closed when one of the producers are sending which creates a panic.

    What happens if you remove the statement close(ch) completely?
    Answer: The channel will be open but because the channel will not be use
            no more the execution will still take place as normal.

    What happens if you increase the number of consumers from 2 to 4?
    Answer: The time for the producers decrease because they have fewer times to wait for a reciever.

    Can you be sure that all strings are printed before the program stops?
